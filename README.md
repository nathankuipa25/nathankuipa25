# Nathan Kuipa – Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub 👋  
I build intelligent systems combining **AI, automation, and real-world problem solving**.  
This repo hosts my work in **Python, Kivy/KivyMD, Django, and robotics development**.  
I believe in learning by building – most projects here are **practical and impactful**.  
Feel free to **explore, fork, and collaborate**. Contributions are always welcome!  
Let’s build something legendary 🚀
