# Nathan Kuipa – Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub 👋  
I’m a student developer interested in **Robotics** and **Machine Learning** ever since I was a kid.  
I build backend systems using **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and mobile UIs with **KivyMD**.  
Most of my projects are **learning-based and practical**, focused on solving real problems step by step.  
I’m improving every day through **experiments, small projects, and consistency**.  
Feel free to explore or collaborate. Suggestions are always welcome ✅

I always believe "**Having Limited Resources in Tech industry ain't a barrier to starting  bringing a change; start with what you have because one is atleast better than None.  If you start today you will never be the same by tomorrow**"
